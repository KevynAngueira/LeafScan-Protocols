# Operational Data Collection Checklist  
(LeafScan – Intended Use)

## A. Personnel Requirements
- [ ] Data collector is trained on LeafScan tool usage
- [ ] Data collector understands LeafScan video pass/fail criteria

---

## B. Required Equipment

### Data Capture
- [ ] LeafScan physical tool
- [ ] Mobile device with OpenMobile installed
- [ ] Device battery ≥ 50%
- [ ] Sufficient local storage for video capture

### Base Width Measurement
- [ ] Precision ruler (minimum 1/16 inch or 1 mm resolution)
- [ ] Temporary leaf-safe marking method (fine-tip marker or tape)

---

## C. Environment Check (Per Session)
- [ ] Adequate ambient lighting for clear leaf visibility
- [ ] No direct glare or reflections on the tool surface or view window
- [ ] Background behind the tool contains **no red, pink, or tool-colored objects**
- [ ] Wind conditions allow the leaf to be held steady during scanning

---

## D. Leaf Eligibility Check (Per Leaf)
- [ ] Leaf is from a corn plant
- [ ] Leaf is accessible without damaging the plant
- [ ] Leaf fits fully within the LeafScan tool channel
- [ ] Leaf can be held **taut and flat** during scanning
- [ ] Leaf is sufficiently intact to allow a continuous scan

---

## E. Base Width Measurements (First X Inches)
- [ ] Leaf collar (base) identified
- [ ] Leaf held taut and flat at the base
- [ ] Base widths marked (1 inch from previous segment) using approved marking procedure
- [ ] Base widths measured using precision ruler or approved reference
- [ ] Base width values recorded in metadata
- [ ] Ensure all X base widths are captured

---

## F. LeafScan Video Capture
- [ ] Leaf oriented correctly within the tool
- [ ] **Entire LeafScan tool** fully visible in the video frame
- [ ] View window unobstructed throughout recording
- [ ] Leaf slides continuously through the view window
- [ ] No pauses, reversals, twisting, or folding during the scan
- [ ] Entire remaining leaf length scanned in a single pass

---

## G. On-Device Validation
- [ ] Tool presence validation passed
- [ ] Leaf motion validation passed
- [ ] Video accepted for upload by the application

---

## H. Post-Capture Confirmation
- [ ] Video playback verified immediately after capture
- [ ] Leaf ID correctly assigned
- [ ] Plant ID correctly assigned
- [ ] Field ID correctly assigned
- [ ] Base width measurement present in metadata
