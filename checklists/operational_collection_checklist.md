# Operational Data Collection Checklist  
(LeafScan – Intended Use)

This checklist verifies that **all required operational steps** were completed
in the correct order during LeafScan data collection.

---

## A. Personnel Requirements
- [ ] Data collector trained on LeafScan tool usage
- [ ] Data collector understands LeafScan **video pass/fail criteria**
- [ ] Data collector understands **two-factor video validation**  
      (system + adjuster visual review)

---

## B. Required Equipment

### Data Capture
- [ ] LeafScan physical tool
- [ ] Mobile device with OpenMobile installed
- [ ] Device battery ≥ 50%
- [ ] Sufficient local storage for video capture

### Base Width Measurement
- [ ] Precision ruler (minimum 1/16 inch or 1 mm resolution)
- [ ] Temporary leaf-safe marking method (fine-tip marker or tape)

---

## C. Environment Check (Per Session)
- [ ] Adequate ambient lighting
- [ ] No glare on tool surface or view window
- [ ] Background contains **no red, pink, or tool-colored objects**
- [ ] Wind conditions allow leaf to be held steady

---

## D. Leaf Selection (Per Leaf)
- [ ] Leaf is from a corn plant
- [ ] Leaf accessible without damaging the plant
- [ ] Leaf fits fully within LeafScan channel
- [ ] Leaf can be held **taut and flat**
- [ ] Leaf sufficiently intact for a continuous scan

---

## E. Base Width Measurements (First X Inches)
- [ ] Leaf collar identified as **first base width**
- [ ] Leaf held taut and flat at the base
- [ ] Base widths marked at **1-inch intervals from previous mark**
- [ ] Base widths measured with approved tool
- [ ] Base width values recorded in metadata
- [ ] Damaged base widths flagged (if applicable)

> Note: If too many base widths are damaged, the system may reject the leaf
and a new representative plant must be selected.

---

## F. LeafScan Video Capture
- [ ] Leaf oriented correctly in tool
- [ ] **Entire LeafScan tool visible** in frame
- [ ] View window unobstructed
- [ ] Leaf slides continuously through view window
- [ ] No pauses, reversals, folding, or twisting
- [ ] Entire remaining leaf scanned in one pass

---

## G. Video Validation (Two-Factor)

### System Validation
- [ ] Tool presence validation passed
- [ ] Leaf motion validation passed
- [ ] Video accepted by application

### Adjuster Visual Review
- [ ] Video reviewed immediately after capture
- [ ] Video meets all capture criteria
- [ ] Video manually accepted or failed by adjuster

> A video must pass **both** system and adjuster review.

---

## H. Post-Capture Confirmation
- [ ] Leaf ID assigned correctly
- [ ] Plant ID assigned correctly
- [ ] Field ID assigned correctly
- [ ] Base width metadata present
- [ ] Video stored successfully
