# 04 – Quality Control

This document defines procedures to verify the quality of collected data.  
Two modes are defined:

1. **Operational Mode QC** – standard checks for all operational data.  
2. **Validation Mode QC** – additional checks on top of operational QC.

---

## Part 1 – Operational Mode QC

### Video Quality
- [ ] Entire LeafScan tool visible
- [ ] Leaf slides continuously through view window
- [ ] No folding, twisting, or reversals
- [ ] Full leaf length captured

### Metadata Consistency
- [ ] Leaf ID, Plant ID, Field ID present
- [ ] Base width measurements recorded
- [ ] Timestamps and device info consistent

### Environment
- [ ] Background free from red/pink/tool-colored objects
- [ ] Lighting adequate
- [ ] Leaf held taut and flat

---

## Part 2 – Validation Mode QC
> Only apply if running validation mode.

### Ground Truth Verification
- [ ] Pre- and post-defoliation leaf areas measured
- [ ] Measurements repeatable (no device errors)
- [ ] Baseline segment widths recorded correctly

### Defoliation Verification
- [ ] Applied defoliation matches recorded method and location
- [ ] Estimated defoliation percentage present
- [ ] Edge cases tested as assigned

### Data Integrity
- [ ] Video and ground truth measurements internally consistent
- [ ] Metadata matches physical measurements
- [ ] Any deviation flagged
