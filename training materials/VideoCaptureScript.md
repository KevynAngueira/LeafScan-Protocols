# LeafScan Video Capture Training Script

**Audience:** Adjusters (Operational + Validation)  
**Format:** Short instructional video (5–8 min) with physical demonstration  
**Companion Document:** `03_LeafScan_video_capture.md`

---

## Opening (Context Setting)

> “LeafScan accuracy depends almost entirely on how the video is captured.  
> This module shows exactly what a valid LeafScan capture looks like — and what invalid captures look like.”

---

## Section 1: What LeafScan Is Actually Recording

**Key Message**
- LeafScan is not capturing a picture of a leaf
- It records a **sequence of fixed-scale cross-sections** for reconstruction

**Script**
> “Each frame in a LeafScan video represents a slice of the leaf at a known scale.  
> If the leaf bends, pauses, reverses, or leaves the tool window, the system cannot reconstruct the leaf correctly.”

**Visuals**
- Diagram: frames stacking into reconstructed leaf
- Overlay showing segment extraction

## Section 2: Tool and Camera Setup

**Key Message**
- Entire tool must remain visible
- Camera is automatically mounted and fixed parallel to the tool

**Script**
> “We designed a special LeafScan tool that simplifies the capture environment.  
> The tool is mounted so the phone is at the perfect distance, parallel to the tool, capturing the entire tool.  
> The frontpiece and backpiece of the tool are magnetically connected. This allows easy placement of the leaf within the channel with minimal effort.  
> The leaf starts within the view window, and the tool is pulled away from the plant. The plant naturally pulls the leaf as the phone and tool move, resulting in a smooth, easy capture.  
> Notably, **it is the tool and mounted phone that move, not the leaf**.”

**Visuals**
- Demonstration of tool setup
- Close-up showing leaf in view window
- Pull-away capture example

## Section 3: Leaf Positioning

**Key Message**
- Leaf stays attached
- Leaf must be flat and taut during the capture

**Script**
> “LeafScan works non-destructively.  
> Keep the leaf attached to the plant and aligned in the channel.  
> The tool and mount handle the motion — you just ensure smooth initial placement.”

**Visuals**
- Proper grip and initial placement
- Common mistakes (twisting, bending)

---

## Section 4: Motion Rules

**Key Message**
- Pull-away is continuous
- No pauses, reversals, or folding

**Script**
> “Once the tool starts pulling, maintain a continuous, smooth motion.  
> Avoid stopping, reversing, or twisting — otherwise the video must be discarded.”

**Visuals**
- Side-by-side: valid vs invalid motion
- Slow-motion pause example

---

## Section 5: Ending the Capture

**Key Message**
- Entire leaf must pass through
- Stop recording after leaf exits view window

**Script**
> “Do not stop recording early.  
> Cutting the video short will invalidate the scan.”

---

## Section 6: Immediate Review

**Key Message**
- Validation is mandatory
- Adjuster review is required

**Script**
> “After capture, the system runs automatic checks, but you must also visually confirm the video is valid.  
> If either check fails, re-capture immediately.”

---

## Closing

> “When in doubt, re-capture. A clean video takes seconds — bad data cannot be fixed later.”
