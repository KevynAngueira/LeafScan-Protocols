# Task Assignments and Edge Cases Training Script

**Audience:** Validation Adjusters, Researchers  
**Format:** Narrated slide deck or doc + optional video  
**Companion Document:** `05_task_assignments.md`

---

## Opening

> “Task assignments exist to intentionally stress the LeafScan system.  
> These are controlled experiments — not mistakes.”

---

## Section 1: Why Task Assignments Exist

**Key Message**
- Operational data ≠ validation data

**Script**
> “Operational data shows system performance under normal conditions.  
> Validation data explores limits, edge cases, and failure modes.”

---

## Section 2: What a Task Assignment Is

**Key Message**
- A quota or condition applied during normal leaf collection

**Script**
> “A task assignment is not a separate workflow.  
> It’s a condition applied during normal per-leaf processing, noted in metadata.”

---

## Section 3: Task Categories

**Script**
> “Tasks fall into four categories:
> 1. **Standard baseline** – normal operation
> 2. **Capture-level edge cases** – partial scans, pauses, tool misalignment
> 3. **Environmental stress** – lighting, background interference
> 4. **Structural extremes** – severe defoliation, damaged base widths, narrow/irregular leaves”

**Visuals**
- Table of categories with examples

## Section 4: Recording Task Metadata

**Key Message**
- Documentation is as important as execution

**Script**
> “When applying a task, record:
> - Task type
> - Leaf ID
> - System pass/fail outcome”

---

## Section 5: Failures Are Valuable

**Key Message**
- Failures are expected in validation

**Script**
> “A system failure during a task is not an operator error.  
> It is a successful validation datapoint.”

---

## Closing

> “Task assignments define the boundaries of trust in LeafScan.  
> Without them, performance metrics would be incomplete.”
