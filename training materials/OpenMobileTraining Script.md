# OpenMobile Workflow Training Script

**Audience:** Adjusters  
**Format:** Screen-recorded walkthrough (6–10 min)  
**Companion Document:** `04_OpenMobile_workflow.md`

## Opening

> “This training covers how to correctly use the OpenMobile app to collect LeafScan data.  
> The app enforces structure — but it cannot fix incorrect entries after the fact, so attention to detail is crucial.”

---

## Section 1: Hierarchy of Annotations

**Key Message**
- Field → Plant → Leaf → Measurements → Video

**Script**
> “OpenMobile allows multilevel annotations:  
> - **Field Annotations** – multiple plants per field  
> - **Plant Annotations** – multiple leaves per plant  
> - **Leaf Annotations** – record measurements and attach videos  

> Videos can be captured directly in the app or imported from any service.  
> If a mistake occurs, **fields can be modified and videos reattached**, but it is still very important to get everything correct during initial collection, because returning to the same plant may not be possible.  
> Once attached, videos are tagged to a specific leaf and cannot be attached to any other leaf.”

## Section 2: Creating or Selecting a Field

**Key Message**
- Verify before proceeding

**Script**
> “Before collecting any data, confirm the field is correct.  
> You can modify field metadata later if needed, but early verification prevents confusion.”

---

## Section 3: Plant Registration

**Key Message**
- One plant at a time
- Correct Plant ID is critical

**Script**
> “Each plant represents a sampling unit.  
> Plant IDs can be corrected later, but try to enter them accurately upfront to avoid downstream errors.”

---

## Section 4: Leaf Registration

**Key Message**
- Leaf ID comes first
- Measurements follow

**Script**
> “Always create the leaf record before entering measurements or attaching videos.  
> If an error occurs, you can modify the data or reattach videos, but proper initial labeling prevents mismatches.”

---

## Section 5: Entering Measurements

**Key Message**
- Accuracy over speed
- Flag damaged widths

**Script**
> “Record leaf length and base widths accurately.  
> If a measurement is damaged or unmeasurable, flag it.  
> Adjustments can be made later if necessary, but returning to the leaf may not be possible.”

---

## Section 6: Video Capture and Attachment

**Key Message**
- Validate before submission
- Videos can be replaced if needed

**Script**
> “Videos can be captured in-app or imported.  
> Ensure the correct video is attached to the correct leaf.  
> If a video is incorrect, it can be removed and reattached.  
> Validation must pass before upload.”

---

## Section 7: Submission and Sync

**Key Message**
- Upload only when complete
- Confirm successful upload

**Script**
> “After collection, sync all data once you have a reliable connection.  
> Confirm uploads before leaving the site.  
> Even though fields and videos can be modified later, completing an accurate initial collection makes the workflow smoother and more reliable.”

---

## Closing

> “OpenMobile preserves structure and allows corrections, but data quality still depends on the adjuster’s careful attention during collection.”
